# Tweets classification

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to predict which tweets are about real disasters and which aren't.
To accomplish this the following steps have been executed:

1. Data preprocessing including feature engineering, text mining operations (to obtain information from tweets), selecting important features.
2. Predictive modelling including testing models of logistic regression, random forest and XGBoost.

## Data set information

The dataset was downloaded from kaggle competition <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview">Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets</a>.
